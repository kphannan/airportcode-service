            tableName: airport_frequencies
            remarks: 'Each row in this dataset represents a single airport radio frequency for voice communication (radio navigation aids appear in navaids.csv). The column airport_ident is a foreign key referencing the ident column in airports.csv for the associated airport.'

            columns:
              - column:
                  name: id
                  type: integer
                  constraints:
                    primaryKey: true
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: 'Internal OurAirports integer identifier for the frequency. This will stay persistent, even if the radio frequency or description changes.'

              - column:
                  name: airport_ref
                  type: integer
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: 'Internal integer foreign key matching the id column for the associated airport in airports.csv. (airport_ident is a better alternative.)'

              - column:
                  name: airport_ident
                  type: char(7)
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: 'Externally-visible string foreign key matching the ident column for the associated airport in airports.csv.'

              - column:
                  name: type
                  type: char(16)
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: 'A code for the frequency type. This isn''t (currently) a controlled vocabulary, but probably will be soon. Some common values are "TWR" (tower), "ATF" or "CTAF" (common traffic frequency), "GND" (ground control), "RMP" (ramp control), "ATIS" (automated weather), "RCO" (remote radio outlet), "ARR" (arrivals), "DEP" (departures), "UNICOM" (monitored ground station), and "RDO" (a flight-service station).'

              - column:
                  name: description
                  type: char(64)
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: 'A description of the frequency, typically the way a pilot would open a call on it.'

              - column:
                  name: frequency_mhz
                  type: decimal(6,2)
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: 'Radio voice frequency in megahertz. Note that the same frequency may appear multiple times for an airport, serving different functions.'
