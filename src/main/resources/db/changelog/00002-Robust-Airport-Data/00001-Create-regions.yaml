                  constraints:
                    primaryKey: true
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: 'Internal OurAirports integer identifier for the region. This will stay persistent, even if the region code changes.'

Whenever possible, these are official ISO 3166:2, at the highest level available, but in some cases OurAirports has to use unofficial codes. There is also a pseudo code "U-A" for each country, which means that the airport has not yet been assigned to a region (or perhaps can''t be, as in the case of a deep-sea oil platform).'
